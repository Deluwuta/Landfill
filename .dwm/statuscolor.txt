^c#FF0000^ Set foreground color.

^b#55cdfc^ Set background color, only applies to text, simply use the ^r^ command to change the background while drawing.

^f<px>^ Forward the X drawing cursor by <px> pixel. Please bear in mind that you have to move the cursor enough to display your drawing (by the with of your drawing).

^d^ Reset colors to SchemeNorm.

^C<num>^ Set foreground color to terminal color 0-15. Requires the xrdb sub-patch above.

^B<num>^ Set background color to terminal color 0-15. Requires the xrdb sub-patch above.

^w^ Swaps the current foreground/background colors. Useful when drawing multiple rectangles on top of one another. Requires the swap-save-restore sub-patch above.

^v^ Saves the current color scheme so it can be restored later with the ^t^ tag. This way a script can modify color in the middle of the bar agnostic to what color was set previously. Requires the swap-save-restore sub-patch above.

^t^ Restores the last color scheme saved by the ^v^ tag. Requires the swap-save-restore sub-patch above.
