Awesome rewrite to remember how this config works. I'll also use this as an excuse to clean up my old (v5) config

## Dependencies
---
This is subject to change because of the activity involved at this point (26/08/2024)
+ ACPI for battery widget
+ nm-applet
+ brightnessctl for brightness control
+ amixer for audio control
+ xwallpaper
+ redshift

## TODO
---
- [ ] Battery widget (wanna do something cute, but the objective is functional minimalism)
- [ ] Internet widget (same idea as with the battery)
- [ ] Brightness and volume popups on change
- [ ] Pretty tags (1-9 are nice tho)
- [ ] Clean readable code (long term objective)

## Special thanks

+ [Amitabha37377 dots](https://github.com/Amitabha37377/Awful-DOTS?tab=readme-ov-file). I'm going to ~~steal~~ get inspiration from their configs.
+ Bling (Modules)
+ Streetturtle (Awesome widgets)

Creation of this file and the config as a whole. Right now is pretty functional, but lacks some features like battery or internet connection state on wibar (those are a must for QoL).

It is using the default awesome config with modified keybinding from my old configs and the theme config as been built from the ground up again.
